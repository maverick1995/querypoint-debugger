Querypoint debugging applies dynamic code analysis with user-interaction to debug code without requiring breakpoints or log statements. For example, the developer asks for the last change of an object property and re-executes the code: the querypoint debugger gives the line and value of the last change.

This project integrates other projects to create an installable Chrome Browser extension. Downloads from this project act like a 'dev' channel for the Querypoint debugger project: weekly updates for the extension hosted in the Chrome Web Store.


To use:
1- Build the extension running the script install.sh
2- Open Chrome with the experimental api flag (--enable-experimental-extension-apis)
3- Go to chrome://extensions/ select the checkbox labeled Developer Mode and click on Load unpacked extension. Select the extension folder built in step 1
